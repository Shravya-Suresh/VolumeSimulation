#Volume Simulation 

Description:

This project is inspired by the intelligent volume adjustment feature in Apple AirPods, which lowers the music volume when voice input is detected. However, traditional implementations often mistake singing along for speech and reduce the volume which will not give a good listening experince. 
Hence, this project is built to predict if input is noise, speech or singing and based on that, if input is singing or noise, the volume will note reduce but if it is speaking only then the volume will reduce.


Dataset:

The dataset consits of three folder, each having cleaned audios of sining, speech and noise to train a CNN model and save the best model to use it to predict the input while listening to music
The dataset links are as follows
